Brixham is at the southern end of Torbay, across the bay (Tor Bay) from Torquay, and is a fishing port. Fishing and tourism are its major industries. At the time of the 2011 census it had a population of 16,693.[1]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is thought that the name ''Brixham'' came from Brioc''s village. ''Brioc'' was an old English or Brythonic personal name and ''-ham'' is an ancient term for village.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe town is hilly and built around the harbour which remains in use as a dock for fishing trawlers. It has a focal tourist attraction in the replica of Sir Francis Drake''s ship the Golden Hind that is permanently moored there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn summer the Cowtown carnival is held, a reminder of when Brixham was two separate communities with only a marshy lane to connect them. Cowtown was the area on top of the hill where the farmers lived, while a mile away in the harbour was Fishtown where the seamen lived. Cowtown, the St Mary''s Square area, is on the road leaving Brixham to the south west, in the direction of Kingswear, upon which stands a church built on the site of a Saxon original. The local Royal British Legion club is also here. The town holds a yearly pirate event which competes for the title of most pirates in one place and this draws visitors from far and wide.\r\n</p>', '', '2014-04-08 21:24:15'),
(23, 'A brief history of Brixham', 'a brief introductory history of the fishing town of Brixham, Devon.', '<p>\r\nAlthough there is evidence of Ice age inhabitants here[citation needed], and probable trading in the Bronze Age, the first evidence of a town comes from the Saxon times. It is possible that Saxon settlement originated by sea from Hampshire in the Sixth Century, or overland around the year 800.[2]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBrixham was called Briseham in the Domesday Book.[3] Its population then was 39.[4]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBrixham was part of the former Haytor Hundred. The population was 3,671 in 1801[citation needed] and 8,092 in 1901. In 1334, the town''s value was assessed at one pound, twelve shillings and eightpence; by 1524, the valuation had risen to £24 and sixteen shillings. It is recorded as a borough from 1536, and a market is recorded from 1822.[5]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWilliam Prince of Orange (afterwards King William III of Great Britain & Ireland) landed in Brixham, with his mainly Dutch army, on 5 November 1688 during the Glorious Revolution, and issued his famous declaration "The Liberties of England and The Protestant Religion I Will Maintain". Many local people still have Dutch surnames, being direct descendants of soldiers in that army.[citation needed] A road leading from the harbour up a steep hill, to where the Dutch made their camp, is still called Overgang, meaning ''passage'' in Dutch.[6]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe coffin house reflects Brixham humour: it is coffin-shaped and when a father was asked for the hand in marriage of his daughter, he said he would ''see her in a coffin, before she wed''. The future son-in-law bought the coffin-shaped property, called it the Coffin House, and went back to the father and said ''Your wishes will be met, you will see your daughter in a coffin, the Coffin House''. Amazed by this, the father gave his blessing.[7]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe street names reflect the town''s history. Pump Street is where the village pump stood. Monksbridge was a bridge built by the monks of Totnes Priory. Lichfield Drive was the route that the dead (from the Anglo-Saxon ''lich'' meaning a corpse) were taken for burial at St Mary’s churchyard. Salutation Mews, near the church, dates from when England was Catholic, and the salutation was to the Virgin Mary. Similarly, Laywell Road recalls Our Lady’s Well. The first building seen when coming into Brixham from Paignton is the old white-boarded Toll House where all travellers had to pay a fee to keep the roads repaired.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe tower of All Saints'' Church, founded in 1815, stands guard over the town. The composer of Abide With Me, Rev. Francis Lyte was a vicar at the church. He lived at Berry Head House, now a hotel, and when he was a very sick man, near to dying, he looked out from his garden as dusk fell over Torbay, and the words of that hymn came into his mind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe main church is St. Mary''s, about a mile from the sea. It is the third to have been on the site (which was an ancient Celtic burial ground). The original wooden Saxon church was replaced by a stone Norman church that was, in its turn, built over in about 1360. Many of the important townspeople are buried in the churchyard.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMany of Brixham''s photogenic cottages above the harbour were originally inhabited by fishermen and their families. Near the harbour is the famous Coffin House mentioned earlier. Many of the dwellings towards Higher Brixham were built largely between the 1930s to 1970s. Several holiday camps were built in this area, for example Pontin''s Wall Park and Dolphin. The Dolphin was one of the company''s biggest camps. The camp closed in 1991 after fire destroyed the main entertainments building.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBrixham was served by the short Torbay and Brixham Railway from Churston. The line, opened in February 1868 to carry passengers and goods (mainly fish), was closed in May 1963 as a result of the Beeching Axe cuts. Although the former line to Brixham is deserted and overgrown, the branch line through nearby Churston is now maintained and operated as a heritage railway by a team of volunteers as the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe British Seaman’s Boys'' Home was founded in 1863 by William Gibbs of Tyntesfield for the orphan sons of deceased British seamen. It was closed in 1988 after 125 years.[8]\r\n</p>', '', '2014-04-08 23:18:30');
