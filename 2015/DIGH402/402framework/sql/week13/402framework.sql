At the time of the 2011 census it had a population of 16,693.[1]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is thought that the name ''Brixham'' came from Brioc''s village. ''Brioc'' was an old English or Brythonic personal name and ''-ham'' is an ancient term for village.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe town is hilly and built around the harbour which remains in use as a dock for fishing trawlers. It has a focal tourist attraction in the replica of Sir Francis Drake''s ship the Golden Hind that is permanently moored there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn summer the Cowtown carnival is held, a reminder of when Brixham was two separate communities with only a marshy lane to connect them. Cowtown was the area on top of the hill where the farmers lived, while a mile away in the harbour was Fishtown where the seamen lived. Cowtown, the St Mary''s Square area, is on the road leaving Brixham to the south west, in the direction of Kingswear, upon which stands a church built on the site of a Saxon original. The local Royal British Legion club is also here. The town holds a yearly pirate event which competes for the title of most pirates in one place and this draws visitors from far and wide.\r\n</p>', '', '2014-04-08 21:24:15'),
