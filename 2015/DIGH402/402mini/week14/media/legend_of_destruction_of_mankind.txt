Then said the Majesty of Ra to this goddess, "Come in peace, come in peace, O Amit," 
and thereupon beautiful women came into being in the city of Amit (or, Amem). And the Majesty of Ra spake [concerning] this goddess, [saying], "Let there be made for her vessels of the beer which produceth sleep at every holy time and season of the year, and they shall be in number according to the number of my hand-maidens;" 
and from that early time until now men have been wont to make on the occasions of the festival of Hathor vessels of the beer which make them to sleep in number according to the number of the handmaidens of Ra. 
    And the Majesty of Ra spake unto this goddess, [saying], "I am smitten with the pain of the fire of sickness; whence cometh to me [this] pain?" 
    And the Majesty of Ra said, "I live, but my heart hath become exceedingly weary with existence with them (i.e., with men); I have slain [some of] them, but there is a remnant of worthless ones, for the destruction which I wrought among them was not as great as my power." 
    Then the gods who were in his following said unto him, "Be not overcome by thy inactivity, for thy might is in proportion to thy will." 
    And the Majesty of this god said unto the Majesty of Nu, "My members are weak for (or, as at) the first time; I will not permit this to come upon me a second time." 
    And the Majesty of the god Nu said, "O son Shu, be thou the Eye 'for thy father ............ and avenue (?) him, and 'thou goddess Nut, place him ........." And the goddess Nut said, "How can this be then, O my father Nu?" 
    "Hail," said Nut .......... to the god Nu, and the goddess straightway became [a cow], and she set the Majesty of Ra. upon [her] back ......... 
    And when these things had been done, men and women saw the god Ra, upon the back [of the cow]. Then these men and women said, "Remain with us, and we will overthrow thine enemies who speak words of blasphemy [against thee], and [destroy them]." 
    Then his Majesty [Re] set out for the Great House, and [the gods who were in the train of Ra remained] with them (i.e., the men); during that time the earth was in darkness. And when the earth became light [again]; and the morning had dawned, the men came forth with their bows and their [weapons], and they set their arms in motion to shoot the enemies [of Ra]. 
    Then said the Majesty of this god, "Your transgressions of violence are placed behind you, for the slaughtering of the enemies is above the slaughter [of sacrifice];" 
thus came into being the slaughter [of sacrifice]. And the Majesty of this god said unto Nut, "I have placed myself upon my back in order to stretch myself out." 
    What then is the meaning of this? It meaneth that he united (?) himself with Nut. [Thus came into being] ......... 
    Then said the Majesty of this god, "I am departing from them (i.e., from men), and he must come after (me) who would see me;" thus came into being ......... 
    Then the Majesty of this god looked forth from its interior, saying, "Gather together [men for me], and make ready for me an abode for multitudes;" thus came into being ............
